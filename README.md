# Introduction to Bayes statistics 

Leave-one-out cross validation (loo-cv) to do model evaluation and obtain Cook's distance using a Baysian lineare regression with ordinary least squares (OLS). Compare Cook's distance based on Baysian loo-cv with analytic solution of Cook's distance bases on frequentist linear regression with OLS.
